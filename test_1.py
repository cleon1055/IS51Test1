This program will determine which payment option, out of two, is better in terms of higher pay.
The first option pays 100 dollars a day for 10 days. The second option pays 1 dollar on the first
day with the amount paid then doubling each day after that for 10 days. There will be two fuctions,
one for each pay option.

Function 1 will calculate the pay total for option 1, and fuction 2 will calculate the pay for option 2.
Function 1 will output 100 * 10.
Function 2 will loop 10 times, each time doubling the previous amount and adding it to the total. 

If amounts for option 1 and option 2 are equal, program will display "Option 1 and Option 2
pay the same."
If option 1 pays more, program will output to user "Option 1 is better."
If option 2 pays more, program will output to user "option 2 is better."
